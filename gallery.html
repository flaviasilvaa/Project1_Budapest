            <p>Budapest is the capital of caves. It is the only capital in the world which has caves of significant size
                and length underneath its buildings and streets. More than two hundred caves are known under the Buda
                side of the town.</p>
            <p>However these caves also have a special place in the world because of their unusual thermal water based
                development.</p>
            <p>The hydrothermal caves of Budapest were created by the same thermal springs that supply the famous spas
                of the capital and the entire area is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p> <br>

            <p>Travelling by the Buda Hill Funicular is a pleasant and a fairly cheap way to save your legs a hike when
                you want to get up to the Buda Castle Hill</p>
            <p>from the river level on Adam Clarke square. Enjoy the ride on a historical cable car!</p>
            <p>Located at the Buda end of the Chain Bridge, the funny ride on the Funicular takes only a few minutes,
                and it does provide a unique and beautiful view of Budapest,</p>
            <p>the River Danube and sights at the top of Castle Hill, such as the Fisherman’s Bastione</p>
