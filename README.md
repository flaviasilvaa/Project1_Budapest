## Testing:
        
        - I tested the page in two different browsers: Chrome and Firefox.
        - I checked and confirmed that the website is responsive in different sizes of screen.
        - I tested the contact page and it works fine as well, the validation of the required fields is working as required.
        
## Validator Testing:

         - HTML: a return error in the HOME page refers to iframe that I could not manage 
           to correct as the W3C validator suggested.
           I tried a few tutorials  and did a bit of research without any success.
           The other pages Gallery and Contact no errors were returned.
           
         - CSS: no errors were found; I just checked the official(Jigsaw) validator.
         
         - Accessibility: the accessibility was checked through the lighthouse in the dev tools.
